"Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) suffer from chronic infections of the lower respiratory tract that can be caused by one or multiple bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which has been particularly problematic to eradicate and been implicated as the major cause of morbidity and mortality in CF patients. Aerosol delivery of antibiotics directly to the lung increases the local concentrations of antibiotic at the site of infection resulting in improved antimicrobial effects compared to systemic administration. Bacterial resistance to current aerosol antibiotic treatments indicate a need for improved therapies to treat CF patients with pulmonary infections caused by multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other bacteria. High concentrations of MP-376 delivered directly to the lung are projected to have antimicrobial effects on even the most resistant organisms and reduce the emergence of resistant bacteria.",ClinicalTrials,2026-01-28T18:40:51.922417,https://clinicaltrials.gov/,Competitor Activity

"The hysterosalpingogram (HSG) is the gold standard of assessing fallopian tube patency and involves the placement of a transcervical catheter to allow for instillation of radio-opaque dye into the uterine cavity and fallopian tubes which are then imaged with abdominal x-ray. A common side effect of the instillation of dye is the uterine cramping, which is both uncomfortable for the patient as well as can cause iatrogenic proximal occlusion of the fallopian tubes. Proximal tubal obstruction is often not representative of true tubal obstruction but is rather an artifact of the test. Prior studies measuring the perceived pain and cramping during HSG have been conducted which have shown reduced pain scores and decreased uterine cramping when warmed contrast dye is used. The researchers propose that the use of warmed contrast media during HSG will be correlated with decreased pain scores and fewer cases of proximal tubal occlusion in women with otherwise normal uterine anatomy.",ClinicalTrials,2026-01-28T18:40:51.922417,https://clinicaltrials.gov/,Side Effects

"Access to treatment for leprosy is essential to global efforts to eliminate leprosy, says the World Health Organization (WHO) ahead of World Leprosy Day, to be observed on 25 January.Leprosy is an infectious disease caused by a type of bacteria, Mycobacterium leprae, and is one of the oldest diseases known to humanity. The disease predominantly affects the skin and peripheral nerves. Left untreated, the disease may cause progressive and permanent disabilities and causes stigma and social isolation. However, the disease can be cured with multidrug therapy (MDT).Efforts to eliminate leprosy have been leading to reductions in the number of new cases in many areas; of the 188 countries, areas or territories that submitted data in 2024, 55 reported zero cases. But still 172 717 new cases were detected worldwide and reported to WHO in the same year.Many partners, including pharmaceutical companies such as Novartis, have been strong supporters of efforts to eliminate leprosy. WHO has collaborated with Novartis since 2000 to provide MDT and clofazimine, free of cost, to all leprosy patients worldwide. This partnership remains one of the most sustained pharmaceutical donation programmes in global health.Marking 25 years of partnership, WHO and Novartis have extended a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for an additional 5 years (2026−2030). The extension makes provision for continued supply of MDT and also includes funding for procurement and distribution of single dose rifampicin (SDR) for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).“The unwavering commitment of partners like Novartis over the past quarter-century has been foundational to the progress made against leprosy,” said Dr Jeremy Farrar, WHO Assistant Director-General for Health Promotion, Disease Prevention and Care. “Their steadfast support in ensuring free access to treatment has helped transform millions of lives and moved us closer to a world free from this ancient disease. This enduring collaboration exemplifies the power of global solidarity in health – a reminder that, together, we can overcome even the oldest and most entrenched health challenges when science, equity, and partnership align.”Availability of free MDT has made it possible to cure the disease, prevent disabilities, mitigate stigma, and has enabled affected individuals to continue working and leading normal lives. Additionally, clofazimine has ensured the treatment of lepra reactions, which are characterized by sudden, severe inflammatory episodes, leading to disabilities, if left untreated.“Leprosy is one of the oldest infectious diseases known to humanity and combatting it has been part of our company’s history since discovering the first effective cure,” said Dr Lutz Hegemann, President of Global Health at Novartis. “Over the last 25 years, we have reached millions of patients together with WHO, and we are committed to going further to pursue our vision of a world free of leprosy.”While significant progress has been made, sustaining and building on this momentum requires political commitment, community engagement and continued collaboration and partnership.The theme for this year’s World Leprosy Day is “Leprosy is curable, the real challenge is stigma”.This year also marks the 25th anniversary of Mr Yohei Sasakawa’s work as the WHO Goodwill Ambassador for Leprosy Elimination. He said, “One of the most stubborn challenges that I encounter on my travels is the social stigma attached to leprosy, which can be more problematic than the disease itself, and which can persist beyond the end of treatment. This is particularly true for people who have been left with residual disabilities as a result of leprosy. They may face various forms of discrimination, including forced divorce, lost educational opportunities and unfair dismissal. Even after being cured, they endure the unending pain of social exclusion.”As leprosy is one of the target diseases under the broader umbrella of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), this work also supports the unified global effort towards a world free of NTDs. Learn more about the collective action and join our campaign on World NTD Day 2026 on 30 January. Notes for editorsThe NTD Roadmap 2021-2030 aims at elimination of leprosy (interruption of transmission). The Global Leprosy Strategy 2021–2030 underpinning the Roadmap, shifts the paradigm beyond the achievement of ‘elimination of leprosy as a public health problem’ toward interruption of transmission and elimination of leprosy disease. Contact screening along with scale-up of preventive chemotherapy and mitigation of stigma and discrimination constitute key pillars of this strategy. Beyond working to ensure that every person affected by leprosy is detected early and treated promptly, WHO leads efforts to combat the discrimination that persons affected by leprosy too often face.",WHO News,"Wed, 21 Jan 2026 17:14:46 Z",https://www.who.int/news/item/21-01-2026-who-renews-commitment-to-a-leprosy-free-world--spotlighting-partnership-and-progress-ahead-of-world-leprosy-day,Side Effects

"Today, the conflict in Sudan reaches its 1000th day, with over 20 million people requiring health assistance and 21 million desperately needing food.Nearly three years of continuous violence, severe access constraints, and reduced funding have turned Sudan into the worst humanitarian crisis globally. An estimated 33.7 million people will need humanitarian aid this year.The health system has been severely damaged by ongoing fighting, increasingly deadly attacks on health care, mass displacement, lack of essential medical supplies, and shortages of health personnel and funding. Despite sustained efforts by WHO and partners to restore and revive health services across the country, more than one third of health facilities (37%) remain non-functional, depriving millions of people of essential and lifesaving health services.Since the start of the conflict in April 2023, WHO has verified 201 attacks on health care, resulting in 1858 deaths and 490 injuries. These attacks, which violate international humanitarian law, undermine access to lifesaving care and put health care workers, patients and caregivers at grave risk.“One thousand days of conflict in Sudan have driven the health system to the brink of collapse. Under the strain of disease, hunger and a lack of access to basic services, people face a devastating situation,” said WHO Representative in Sudan, Dr Shible Sahbani. “WHO is doing what we can, where we can, and we know we are saving lives and rebuilding the health system. Despite the challenges, we are also working on recovery of the health system.”The level of displacement is unprecedented. An estimated 13.6 million people are currently displaced, making Sudan the largest displacement crisis in the world. Fueled by poor living conditions, overcrowding in displacement sites, disrupted health and water, sanitation and hygiene services, and a breakdown of routine immunization, disease outbreaks are spreading, compounding the crisis. WHO is currently supporting the response to outbreaks of cholera, dengue, malaria, and measles, with cholera being reported from all 18 states, dengue from 14 states, and malaria from 16 states. Access to preventive and curative care, including for the management of chronic conditions and severe malnutrition, remains limited.WHO works with Sudan’s Federal and State Ministries of Health and partners to improve access to critical health services across Sudan and rehabilitate the health system. Since the start of the conflict in April 2023, WHO has delivered 3378 metric tons of medicines and medical supplies worth about US$ 40 million, including diagnostic supplies, treatments for malnutrition, and diseases such as cholera, malaria, dengue, and emergency surgery, to 48 health partners for lifesaving operations. About 24 million people have received cholera vaccinations, and WHO has supported the country to introduce and scale up malaria vaccines. Additionally, more than 3.3 million people have accessed health care at WHO-supported hospitals, primary health care facilities, and temporary mobile clinics. More than 112 400 children with severe acute malnutrition with medical complications have received treatment at functional stabilization centres, all of which receive lifesaving WHO nutrition supplies. State and National public health laboratories have been equipped and strengthened to confirm disease outbreaks and enable a rapid response.“As the relentless conflict renders some areas inaccessible, particularly in the Darfur and Kordofan regions, the population’s health needs continue to increase,” Dr Sahbani said. “To meet these mounting needs and prevent the crisis from spiraling out of hand, WHO and humanitarian partners require safe and unimpeded access to all areas of Sudan, and increased financial resources.”Ultimately, WHO calls parties to the conflict to urgently work towards a ceasefire and peace for the people of Sudan.",WHO News,"Mon, 12 Jan 2026 10:44:06 Z",https://www.who.int/news/item/09-01-2026-sudan-1000-days-of-war-deepen-the-world-s-worst-health-and-humanitarian-crisis,Marketing/Promotion
"The second WHO Global Summit on Traditional Medicine, jointly organized with the Government of India, concluded today in New Delhi, marking a major milestone for global health as it drew over 16 000 online registrations and brought together 800 delegates from more than 100 countries, including ministers from over 20 nations. Combined with a strong line up of 160 speakers, the global traditional medicine community shared insights on how traditional medicine (TM) can strengthen health systems with more safe, evidence-based, and affordable care. The energy in Delhi was palpable as ministers, scientists, Indigenous leaders, and practitioners came together to advance the WHO Global Traditional Medicine Strategy 2025–2034. The Summit was not just about dialogue – it was about action. WHO unveiled the Traditional Medicine Global Library, a first-of-its-kind digital platform consolidating 1.6 million resources on TM, from scientific studies to Indigenous knowledge. With advanced features like Evidence Gap Maps and an AI-powered tool, TMGL GPT, the Library promises to transform access to trusted information and accelerate research worldwide. Innovation took centre stage with the launch of Health & Heritage Innovations (H2I), an initiative to nurture breakthrough ideas that bridge traditional practices with cutting-edge technologies such as AI, genomics, and digital health. From over 1000 submissions, 21 finalists were announced at the Summit and will enter a year-long acceleration programme to refine prototypes, receive scientific and regulatory guidance, and connect with policy-makers and investors. WHO also announced the Strategic and Technical Advisory Group on Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (STAG-TM), a new advisory body to guide the Global Strategy. Comprised of 19 independent experts, STAG-TM will shape research priorities, develop standards, and advise on integration into health systems. At its inaugural meeting during the Summit, the group set urgent priorities: evidence generation, preservation of traditional knowledge, digital innovation, and capacity building. Countries rallied behind the Delhi Declaration, with commitments from 26 Member States, signaling a new era for traditional medicine. This collective pledge focuses on integrating traditional medicine into primary health care, strengthening regulation and safety standards, investing in research, and building interoperable data systems to track outcomes. It’s a shift from recognition to results – ensuring traditional medicine is not a parallel system but a driver of universal health coverage. “Through the Delhi Commitment, countries have agreed not only on why traditional medicine matters – but on how to act,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Traditional medicine can help to address many of the threats to health of our modern world: the growing burden of noncommunicable diseases; inequitable access to health services; and climate change. It can help to support care that is person-centred, culturally grounded, and holistic.” Looking ahead, WHO will work with Member States to turn these commitments into reality– scaling access to trusted knowledge, accelerating innovation, and embedding TM into health systems everywhere.

"The World Health Organization (WHO) has validated Brazil for the elimination of mother-to-child transmission (EMTCT) of HIV, making it the most populous country in the Americas to achieve this historic milestone. This accomplishment reflects Brazil’s long-standing commitment to universal and free access to health services through its Unified Health System (SUS), anchored in a strong primary health-care system and respect for human rights.“Eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV is a major public health achievement for any country, especially for a country as large and complex as Brazil,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Brazil has shown that with sustained political commitment and equitable access to quality health services, every country can ensure that every child is born free of HIV and every mother receives the care she deserves.”The milestone was marked during a ceremony in Brasília, attended by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Brazil’s Minister of Health Alexandre Padilha, and the Director of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Dr Jarbas Barbosa, along with representatives from UNAIDS.Meeting validation criteriaBrazil met all the criteria for EMTCT validation, including reducing vertical transmission of HIV to below 2% and achieving over 95% coverage for prenatal care, routine HIV testing, and timely treatment for pregnant women living with HIV. In addition to meeting the targets of the validation, Brazil demonstrated the delivery of quality services for mothers and their infants, robust data and laboratory systems, and a strong commitment to human rights, gender equality and community engagement.The country implemented a progressive, subnational approach by first certifying states and municipalities with over 100 000 inhabitants, adapting the PAHO/WHO validation methodology to its national context while maintaining coherence across the country.The evaluation, supported by PAHO, was conducted by independent experts who reviewed data, documentation, and health facility operations. Findings were then assessed by WHO’s Global Validation Advisory Committee, which formally recommended Brazil’s validation for elimination.“This achievement shows that eliminating vertical transmission of HIV is possible when pregnant women know their HIV status, receive timely treatment, and have access to maternal health services and safe delivery,” said Dr Jarbas Barbosa, Director of PAHO. “It is also the result of the tireless dedication of thousands of health professionals, community health workers, and civil society organizations. Every day, they sustain the continuity of care, identify obstacles, and work to overcome them, ensuring that even the most vulnerable populations can access essential health services.""Part of a broader initiativeOver the past decade (2015-2024), more than 50 000 pediatric HIV infections have been averted in the Region of the Americas as a result of the implementation of the initiative to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV.Brazil’s success is part of the broader EMTCT Plus Initiative, which seeks to eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B, and congenital Chagas, in collaboration with UNICEF and UNAIDS. It is embedded within PAHO’s Elimination Initiative, a regional effort to eliminate more than 30 communicable diseases and related conditions in the Americas by 2030.""I am delighted that Brazil has just been certified by WHO/PAHO for eliminating vertical transmission – the first country of more than 100 million people to do so,” said Winnie Byanyima, UNAIDS Executive Director. “And they did it by doing what we know works –prioritizing universal health care, tackling the social determinants that drive the epidemic, protecting human rights, and even – when necessary – breaking monopolies to secure access to medicines.""Global contextBrazil is one of 19 countries and territories worldwide that have been validated by WHO for EMTCT. Twelve of these are in the Region of the Americas. In 2015, Cuba became the first country in the world to be validated for EMTCT of HIV and the elimination of congenital syphilis. Other countries in the Region include Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Montserrat, and Saint Kitts and Nevis in 2017; Dominica in 2020; Belize in 2023; and Jamaica and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in 2024.Outside the Americas, countries validated for EMTCT of HIV include Armenia, Belarus, Malaysia, Maldives, Oman, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.",WHO News,"Thu, 18 Dec 2025 15:43:16 Z",https://www.who.int/news/item/18-12-2025-who-validates-brazil-for-eliminating-mother-to-child-transmission-of-hiv,Brand Perception
"The World Health Organization (WHO)’s Second Global Summit on Traditional Medicine, jointly organized with the Government of India, opens today, bringing together government ministers, scientists, Indigenous leaders, and practitioners from more than 100 countries. The Summit is expected to announce major scientific initiatives and new commitments aimed at advancing the implementation of the WHO Global Traditional Medicine Strategy 2025–2034, centred on stronger evidence, better regulation, systems integration, collaboration and community engagement. Traditional medicine (TM) encompasses codified and non-codified systems that predate biomedicine and have continued to evolve for contemporary use. For many, TM remains the main source of health care—locally accessible, affordable and bio-culturally aligned—and for many more, it is a preferred, personalized and more natural health option. Nearly 90% of WHO Member States (170 out of 194) report that 40–90% of their populations use TM.“WHO is committed to uniting the wisdom of millennia with the power of modern science and technology to realise the vision of health for all,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “By engaging responsibly, ethically, and equitably, and by harnessing innovation from AI to genomics, we can unlock the potential of traditional medicine to deliver safer, smarter, and more sustainable health solutions for every community and for our planet.”Strengthening evidence, regulation and integration of TM into health systemsIn a world facing increasing challenges to health systems, nearly half of the global population – 4.6 billion – lack access to essential health services, while a quarter – over 2 billion people – experience financial hardship to access health care. Integrating TM into health systems is critical to expanding access and choice to affordable, people-centred health care and advancing UHC, ensuring everyone can receive health care they need without financial strain.Emerging evidence indicates that integrating TM into health systems can deliver cost efficiencies and improve health outcomes. Such integration emphasizes prevention and health promotion, contributing to broader health benefits such as more appropriate use of antibiotics.Achieving effective integration requires robust science, global standards for quality and safety, and strong regulatory mechanisms. “We need to apply the same scientific rigour to the assessment and validation of biomedicine and traditional medicines, while respecting biodiversity, cultural specificities and ethical principles,” said Dr Sylvie Briand, WHO Chief Scientist. “Stronger collaborations and frontier technologies – such as AI, genomics, systems biology, neurosciences and advanced data analytics – can transform how we study and apply traditional medicine.”Advancing innovation, investment and sustainable benefitsTM underpins fast-growing global industries, such as herbal medicines. All TM formulations, and more than half of biomedical pharmaceuticals, originate from natural resources, which remain a vital source for new drug discovery. Indigenous Peoples safeguard around 40% of the world’s biodiversity while representing just 6% of the global population. Advancing TM requires addressing Indigenous rights, fair trade, and benefit-sharing considerations.Despite TM’s widespread use and vital role in stewarding natural resources for health and well-being, less than 1% of global health research funding is dedicated to TM. To help close the knowledge and research gaps, WHO is launching the Traditional Medicine Global Library, the first of its kind, featuring more than 1.6 million scientific records spanning research, policies, regulations and thematic collections on diverse TM applications. Developed in response to calls by Heads of State during G20 and BRICS meetings in 2023, the Library also provides equitable online access to peer-reviewed content for institutions in lower-income countries through the Research4Life initiative. It also supports countries in documenting TM with intellectual property protections and in building scientific capacity to drive innovation. “Advancing traditional medicine is an evidence-based, ethical and environmental imperative,” said Dr Shyama Kuruvilla, Director a.i. of WHO’s Global Traditional Medicine Centre. “The Global Summit fosters the conditions and collaborations required for TM to contribute at scale to the flourishing of all people and the planet.”The Summit (17–19 December 2025, New Delhi) will also announce new commitments from governments and other stakeholders, alongside a call for a global consortium to address systemic gaps and accelerate implementation of the Global TM Strategy at scale.",WHO News,"Wed, 17 Dec 2025 08:09:29 Z",https://www.who.int/news/item/17-12-2025-who-hosts-the-second-global-summit-to-advance-evidence--integration-and-innovation-for-traditional-medicine,Regulation/Policy

"Since 2000, most countries – across all income levels and regions – have made concurrent progress in expanding health service coverage and reducing the financial hardship associated with health costs, according to a new joint report from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank Group. These two indicators are the foundation of universal health coverage (UHC) – the global commitment that everyone, everywhere can access the care they need without financial hardship by 2030.The UHC Global Monitoring Report 2025 shows that health service coverage, measured by the Service Coverage Index (SCI), rose from 54 to 71 points between 2000 and 2023. Meanwhile, the share of people experiencing financial hardship due to large and impoverishing out-of-pocket (OOP) health payments declined from 34% to 26% between 2000 and 2022.However, the report cautions that the poorest populations continue to bear the greatest burden of unaffordable health costs, with 1.6 billion people further pushed into poverty. Overall, an estimated 4.6 billion people worldwide still lack access to essential health services and 2.1 billion people experience financial hardship to access health care, including the 1.6 billion people living in poverty or pushed deeper into it due to health expenses.""Universal health coverage is the ultimate expression of the right to health, but this report shows that for billions of people who cannot access or afford the health services they need, that right remains out of reach,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “In the context of severe cuts to international aid, now is the time for countries to invest in their health systems, to protect the health of their people and economies. WHO is supporting them to do that.”Financial hardship in health is defined as household spending more than 40% of its discretionary budget on OOP health expenses. Cost of medicines is a major driver of financial hardship: in three-quarters of countries with available data, medicines account for at least 55% of people’s OOP health expenses. The burden is even greater among people living in poverty who allocate a median of 60% of their OOP health expenses on medicines diverting their scarce resources from other essential needs.While the burden of OOP health costs falls mostly on poorer people, it also affects better-off segments of the population that allocate a large share of their budgets to health expenses, particularly in middle-income countries where this group of people is growing.Without faster progress, full-service coverage without financial hardship will remain out of reach for many: the global SCI is projected to reach only 74 out of 100 by 2030, with nearly 1 in 4 people worldwide still facing financial hardship at the end of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) era.Encouraging progress in low-income countries with largest gapsDespite positive direction, the global progress rate has slowed since 2015 with only one-third of countries improving in both increasing health coverage and reducing financial hardship. All WHO regions have improved service coverage, but only half – Africa, South-East Asia, the Western Pacific – also reduced financial hardship. Low-income countries achieved the fastest gains in both areas but are still facing the largest gaps.The global increase in health service coverage has been driven largely by advances in infectious disease programmes. Coverage for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) has shown steady improvement, while gains in reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health have been modest.The report notes that improved sanitation has supported service coverage gains. At the same time, inclusive economic growth, rising incomes, and stronger social protection mechanisms have driven poverty reduction, especially in low-income countries, contributing to declines in financial hardship. However, health costs have increasingly become a source of financial hardship among the poor.Inequalities are getting starkerDespite progress, persistent gaps and inequalities are on the rise. In 2022, 3 out of 4 people among the poorest segment of the populations faced financial hardship from health costs, compared with fewer than 1 in 25 among the richest.Women, people living in poverty, or in rural areas, or with less education, reported greater difficulty accessing essential health services. The gap between women in the richest and poorest quintiles narrowed slightly, from about 38 to 33 percentage points over the past decade. Even in high-performing regions such as Europe, vulnerable groups – including the poorest and people with disabilities – continue to report higher unmet health needs.These findings likely underestimate the true extent of health inequalities, as the most vulnerable groups – such as displaced populations and people living in informal settlements – are often missing in data sources used to monitor progress toward UHC.Actions leading to 2030Achieving the UHC goal by 2030 is central to realizing the human right to health. With five years remaining on the SDG agenda, urgent action is now needed to drive progress. The report underscores the critical role of political commitment in every country and community, and calls for action in six core areas:ensure essential health care is free at the point of care for people living in poverty and vulnerable situations;expand public investments in health systems;address high out-of-pocket spending on medicines;accelerate access to essential NCD services, especially as the disease burden rises;strengthen primary health care to promote equity and efficiency; and adopt multisectoral approaches, recognizing that determinants of health and UHC drivers extend beyond the health sector. Editor’s noteThis edition of the UHC Global Monitoring Report 2025 reflects the first round of UHC tracking to incorporate revised SDG indicators for health service coverage (SDG 3.8.1) and financial hardship (SDG 3.8.2), introduced in 2025. Using the revised indicators, and reproduction of the full time series, the report has presented global and regional trends in service coverage from 2000 to 2023, based on time series data for 195 countries or territories, and global and regional trends in financial hardship from 2000 to 2022, based on primary country time series for 168 countries. More about monitoring universal health coverage.The Report is presented at the UHC High-Level Forum, jointly hosted by the Government of Japan, the World Bank Group, and WHO, in Tokyo, Japan. The Forum will also mark the official launch of the UHC Knowledge Hub in Tokyo, established by WHO and the World Bank Group with the support of the Government of Japan.

"WHO Member States today ended their latest round of intensive negotiations on the world’s first Pathogen Access andBenefit Sharing (PABS) system. Countries decided to resume deliberations in January in a reflection of the shared commitment and urgency needed to help make the world safer from future pandemics.Countries convened for the fourth meeting of the Intergovernmental Working Group (IGWG) on the WHO Pandemic Agreement in Geneva from 1–5 December 2025. They requested to extend the current fourth round of negotiations, agreeing to resume from 20–22 January 2026.The World Health Assembly established the IGWG to undertake several tasks, including, as a priority, to draft and negotiate the PABS annex to the WHO Pandemic Agreement. Member States requested the establishment of a PABS platform to operate as a global system to share pathogens and their genetic information, along with the benefits that arise from their use, in a timely, fair and transparent way. This would pave the way for a more effective and equitable response to the next pandemic.“As we cross the halfway mark in negotiations on the Pathogen Access and Benefit-Sharing (PABS) system, I am encouraged by the progress we’ve made towards enabling a faster and more equitable global response to future pandemics,"" said IGWG Bureau co-chair Mr Matthew Harpur of the United Kingdom. ""Member States have demonstrated real commitment to finding common ground and bridging differences, as we work to deliver a strong PABS system by the next World Health Assembly.”IGWG Bureau co-Chair Ambassador Tovar da Silva Nunes, of Brazil, said: “WHO Member States have shown their dedication to finishing this important task. The progress achieved on access, benefit-sharing and core governance areas provides the foundation to move the process forward. We are confident we can build a strong and balanced PABS system that will benefit all people.” WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus added: “This is both a generational opportunity and a generational responsibility. I thank Member States and the IGWG Bureau for rising to the occasion. As we get ready to close out this year, we are in a strong position to forge consensus, finalize the draft, and prepare for adoption at next year’s World Health Assembly. Together, we are moving toward a world that is better prepared for future pandemics.""

"On World AIDS Day, the World Health Organization (WHO) calls on governments and partners to rapidly expand access to new WHO-approved tools including lenacapavir (LEN) to drive down infections and counter disruption to essential health services caused by cuts to foreign aid.Despite dramatic funding setbacks, the global HIV response has gained a remarkable momentum in 2025 with the introduction and WHO approval of twice-yearly injectable lenacapavir for HIV prevention. LEN, a highly effective, long-acting alternative to oral pills and other options, is a transformative intervention for people who face challenges with regular adherence and stigma in accessing health care. WHO released in July this year new guidelines recommending the use of lenacapavir as an additional pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) option for HIV prevention.Sharp and sudden reductions in international funding this year led to disruptions in HIV prevention, treatment and testing services, with essential community-led programmes, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and harm reduction initiatives for people who inject drugs, being scaled back or shut down entirely in some countries. “We face significant challenges, with cuts to international funding, and prevention stalling,"" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “At the same time, we have significant opportunities, with exciting new tools with the potential to change the trajectory of the HIV epidemic. Expanding access to those tools for people at risk of HIV everywhere must be priority number one for all governments and partners.”Marking World AIDS Day under the theme “Overcoming disruption, transforming the AIDS response”, WHO is urging a dual track approach – solidarity and investment in innovations to protect and empower communities most at risk.After decades of progress, the HIV response stands at a crossroads. In 2024:HIV prevention efforts stagnated, with 1.3 million new infections, disproportionately impacting key and vulnerable populations; UNAIDS data reveal that almost half (49%) of new HIV infections occurred among key populations – including sex workers, men who have sex with men, transgender women, and people who inject drugs – and their sexual partners; while sex workers and transgender women face a 17-fold higher risk of acquiring HIV, men who have sex with men face an 18-fold higher risk, and people who inject drugs – a 34-fold higher risk; underlying drivers include stigma, discrimination, and legal, social and structural barriers these groups face to access HIV care; and globally, an estimated 40.8 million people were living with HIV, and 630 000 people died from HIV-related causes.While the full scale of the impact of foreign aid cuts is still being assessed, access to PrEP is believed to have declined dramatically. The AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition estimates that, as of October 2025, 2.5 million people who used PrEP in 2024 lost access to their medications in 2025 due solely to donor funding cuts. Such disruptions could have far-reaching consequences for the global HIV response, jeopardizing efforts to end AIDS by 2030. Momentum for innovation “We are entering a new era of powerful innovations in HIV prevention and treatment,” said Dr Tereza Kasaeva, Director of WHO’s Department for HIV, TB, Hepatitis and STIs. “By pairing these advances with decisive action, supporting communities, and removing structural barriers, we can ensure that key and vulnerable populations have full access to life-saving services.” WHO prequalified LEN for HIV prevention on 6 October 2025, followed by national regulatory approvals that will increase access in South Africa (on 27 October), Zimbabwe (27 November) and Zambia (4 November). WHO’s Collaborative Registration Procedure (CRP) supported these approvals. WHO is also working closely with partners such as CIFF, the Gates Foundation, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and Unitaid to enable affordable access to LEN in countries. Ensuring that long-acting HIV medicines for prevention and treatment reach priority populations must be a global priority. Integrating HIV services into primary health careWHO emphasizes that ending the AIDS epidemic depends on a fully integrated, evidence-based and rights-driven approach under the umbrella of primary health care. WHO will continue working with partners and leaders to put those most affected at the centre of the HIV response. Despite funding setbacks, the resilience and leadership of communities offer a clear path forward. By strengthening health systems, increasing domestic investment, and protecting human rights, countries can safeguard gains and ensure no one is left behind.",WHO News,"Sun, 30 Nov 2025 17:04:40 Z",https://www.who.int/news/item/01-12-2025-new-prevention-tools-and-investment-in-services-essential-in-the-fight-against-aids,Regulation/Policy

"Violence against women remains one of the world’s most persistent and under-addressed human rights crises, with very little progress in two decades, according to a landmark report released today by the World Health Organization (WHO) and UN partners.Nearly 1 in 3 women – estimated 840 million globally – have experienced partner or sexual violence during their lifetime, a figure that has barely changed since 2000. In the last 12 months alone, 316 million women – 11% of those aged 15 or older – were subjected to physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner. Progress on reducing intimate partner violence has been painfully slow with only 0.2% annual decline over the past two decades.For the first time, the report includes national and regional estimates of sexual violence by someone other than a partner. It finds 263 million women have experienced non-partner sexual violence since age 15, a figure experts caution is significantly under-reported due to stigma and fear.""Violence against women is one of humanity’s oldest and most pervasive injustices, yet still one of the least acted upon,"" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. ""No society can call itself fair, safe or healthy while half its population lives in fear. Ending this violence is not only a matter of policy; it is a matter of dignity, equality and human rights. Behind every statistic is a woman or girl whose life has been forever altered. Empowering women and girls is not optional, it's a prerequisite for peace, development and health. A safer world for women is a better world for everyone.""Efforts face funding cuts amidst mounting needsThe new report, released ahead of the International day for the elimination of violence against women and girls observed on 25 November, represents the most comprehensive study on the prevalence of these two forms of violence against women. It updates 2018 estimates released in 2021. It analyses data between 2000 and 2023 from 168 countries, revealing a stark picture of a deeply neglected crisis and critically underfunded response.Despite mounting evidence on effective strategies to prevent violence against women, the report warns that funding for such initiatives is collapsing – just as when humanitarian emergencies, technological shifts, and rising socio-economic inequality are further increasing risks for millions of women and girls. For instance, in 2022, only 0.2% of the global development aid was allocated to programmes focused on prevention of violence against women, and funding has further fallen in 2025.Widespread and lifelong risksWomen subjected to violence face unintended pregnancies, a higher risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections and experiencing depression. Sexual and reproductive health services are an important entry point for survivors to receive the high-quality care they need.The report underscores the reality that violence against women begins early and risks persist throughout life. For example, in the past 12 months alone, 12.5 million adolescent girls 15-19 years of age or 16% have experienced physical and/or sexual violence from an intimate partner.While violence occurs in every country, women in least-developed, conflict-affected, and climate-vulnerable settings are disproportionately affected. For example, Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) reports 38% prevalence of intimate partner violence in the past year – more than 3 times the global average of 11%.A call for action – and accountabilityMore countries than ever are now collecting data to inform policies, yet significant gaps remain – particularly on non-partner sexual violence, marginalized groups such as indigenous women, migrants, and women with disabilities, as well as data from fragile and humanitarian settings. Progress has been achieved in countries where there is political commitment to do so. For example, Cambodia is implementing a national project that will update legislation on domestic violence, improve service delivery, quality and access, refurbish shelters and leverage digital solutions in schools and communities to promote prevention especially with adolescents.Ecuador, Liberia, Trinidad and Tobago and Uganda have developed costed national action plans. Legislative and advocacy actions in these countries have contributed to some domestic financing for this issue, signalling increased political commitment at a time of decreasing aid budgets. To accelerate global progress and deliver meaningful change for the lives of affected women and girls, the report calls for decisive government action and funding to:scale up evidence-based prevention programmesstrengthen survivor-centred health, legal and social servicesinvest in data systems to track progress and reach the most at-risk groupsenforce laws and policies empowering women and girls.The report is accompanied by the launch of the second edition of the RESPECT Women: preventing violence against women framework, offering updated guidance for violence prevention, including for humanitarian contexts.There can be no more silence or inaction. We need leaders to commit and act towards ending violence against women and girls now.Quotes from partners""Ending violence against women and girls requires courage, commitment, and collective action. Advancing gender equality is how we build a more equal, safer world for everyone, where every woman and every girl can live a life free from violence.” Dr Sima Bahous, Executive Director, UN Women ""Violence against women inflicts deep and lasting harm that affects their lives, health and dignity. For many, violence is compounded by discrimination based on poverty, disability and other factors, exposing them to even higher risk. The devastating cycle of abuse often ripples through families and communities and across generations. The data paint a grim picture of the toll of inaction. This must change now. We must act urgently together to end this violence and ensure that every woman and girl, in all her diversity, can exercise her rights, realize her potential and contribute fully to more just, equal and prosperous societies.” Diene Keita, Executive Director, UNFPA “The data shows that many women first experience violence from a partner when they are adolescents. And many children grow up watching their mothers being pushed, hit or humiliated, with violence a part of daily life. The key is to break this pattern of violence against women and girls.” UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell Notes to the editorsAbout the reportThe report, Global, regional and national prevalence estimates for intimate partner violence against women and non-partner sexual violence against women, 2023 was developed by WHO and the UNDP-UNFPA-UNICEF-WHO-World Bank Special Programme of Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP) on behalf of, and with the United Nations Inter-Agency Working Group on Violence Against Women Estimation and Data. The Working Group includes representatives from WHO, UN Women, UNICEF, UNFPA, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD).Modelling is used to enhance comparability of estimates across countries and regions to the extent allowed by existing data. All surveys likely underestimate the actual prevalence of violence against women as there will always be women who do not disclose these experiences, especially where this violence is highly stigmatized. Sexual violence is particularly underreported in many settings. Poorly designed or implemented surveys in some places further exacerbate this underestimation.About regional and country estimatesThe report and database present regional data in the following categories: Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) regions, WHO regions, Global Burden of Disease (GBD) regions, UNFPA regions and UNICEF regions. Data is also presented for 168 countries and areas for women aged 15-49 years old.

"The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that gonorrhoea, a sexually transmitted infection, is becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics, according to new data from its Enhanced Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme (EGASP), which monitors the spread of drug-resistant gonorrhoea. The report highlights the need to strengthen surveillance, improve diagnostic capacity and ensure equitable access to new treatments for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The release of the new data coincides with World Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Awareness Week, reinforcing the importance of global action against drug-resistant infections. EGASP, launched by WHO in 2015, collects laboratory and clinical data from sentinel sites around the world to track AMR and inform treatment guidelines.“This global effort is essential to tracking, preventing, and responding to drug-resistant gonorrhoea and to protecting public health worldwide,” said Dr Tereza Kasaeva, Director of the WHO Department for HIV, TB, Hepatitis & STIs. “WHO calls on all countries to address the rising levels of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and integrate gonorrhoea surveillance into national STI programmes.” Between 2022 and 2024, resistance to ceftriaxone and cefixime, the primary antibiotics used to treat gonorrhoea, rose sharply from 0.8% to 5% and from 1.7% to 11% respectively, with resistant strains detected in more countries. Resistance to azithromycin remained stable at 4%, while resistance to ciprofloxacin reached 95%. Cambodia and Viet Nam reported the highest resistance rates.In 2024, 12 EGASP countries in five WHO regions provided data, an increase from just four countries in 2022. This is a positive development reflecting growing commitment to track and contain drug-resistant infections in countries and regions. The countries- Brazil, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Malawi, the Philippines, Qatar, South Africa, Sweden, Thailand, Uganda and Viet Nam reported 3615 cases of gonorrhoea.Over half of all cases of symptomatic gonorrhoea in men (52%) were reported from countries in the WHO Western Pacific Region, including the Philippines (28%), Viet Nam (12%), Cambodia (9%) and Indonesia (3%). Countries of the WHO African Region accounted for 28% of cases, followed by countries in the South-East Asia Region (13%, Thailand), the Eastern Mediterranean Region (4%, Qatar) and the Region of the Americas (2%, Brazil).The median patient age was 27 years (range: 12–94). Among cases, 20% were men who have sex with men, and 42% reported multiple sexual partners within the past 30 days. Eight percent reported recent antibiotic use, and 19% had travelled recently. Strengthening and expanding global surveillanceIn 2024, WHO advanced genomic surveillance, with nearly 3000 samples sequenced from eight countries. Landmark studies on new treatments such as zoliflodacin and gepotidacin, as well as studies on tetracycline resistance, were conducted by WHO’s Collaborating Centre on AMR in STI in Sweden, in coordination with WHO. These are helping guide future gonorrhoea control and doxycycline-based prevention (DoxyPEP) strategies. EGASP continued to expand its reach in 2024, with Brazil, Côte d’Ivoire and Qatar joining the programme, and India beginning implementation and data reporting starting in 2025 under its National AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases Control Programme.Despite notable progress, EGASP faces challenges, including limited funding, incomplete reporting, and gaps in data from women and extragenital sites. WHO calls for urgent investment, particularly in national surveillance systems, to sustain and expand global gonococcal AMR surveillance.",WHO News,"Wed, 19 Nov 2025 10:01:44 Z",https://www.who.int/news/item/19-11-2025-more-countries-report-rising-levels-of-drug-resistant-gonorrhoea--warns-who,Marketing/Promotion

"The World Health Organization (WHO) is marking its first official observance of World Prematurity Day with the launch of a new global clinical practice guide for Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) – a simple, proven and life-saving intervention that significantly improves survival for preterm and low birth weight babies.Each year, an estimated 15 million babies are born too soon (before 37 weeks of pregnancy), and complications from preterm birth are the leading cause of death among children under five years of age. In the poorest countries, most extremely preterm babies die within days – whereas in high-income countries, almost all survive.KMC – which combines prolonged skin to skin contact with breast-milk feeding – has been shown to dramatically improve outcomes for small and preterm newborns, and to be feasible and cost-effective in all settings. Among other positive impacts, it is associated with a more than 30% reduction in newborn deaths, a close to 70% reduction in hypothermia and a 15% reduction in severe infections – as well as improved weight gain and better longer-term health and cognitive development. “KMC is not just a clinical intervention – it empowers mothers and families and transforms newborn care,” said Dr Jeremy Farrar, WHO’s Assistant Director-General for Health Promotion, Disease Prevention and Care. “It should now be universal clinical practice for all small and preterm babies, ensuring they have the best chance to survive and thrive.”A lifesaving intervention for all babies born early or smallGeared at health workers, facility managers as well as caregivers, the new WHO guide offers detailed, step-by-step, adaptable guidance for initiating, maintaining, and monitoring KMC. It states that all preterm or low birth weight newborns should receive KMC starting immediately after birth - unless they are unable to breathe on their own or their blood pressure and circulation drops to dangerously low levels, requiring urgent treatment. While mothers should typically be the primary providers, fathers and other family members can also give KMC if the mother is unable – as well as providing critical emotional and practical support. KMC can be practiced at all levels of health facilities – from the labour room or the operating theatre to postnatal wards and special or intensive newborn care units – and can be continued at home. The guide includes practical tips on how to secure the baby in the KMC position, whether using simple cloth wraps, elastic binders or specially designed garments. It also outlines how health facilities create enabling environments for KMC through supportive policies and training staff. Family-friendly approaches are crucial for successful implementation, the guide notes – including ensuring mothers can always be together in the same room as their babies.All small and sick newborns need dedicated medical care and attentionOn this World Prematurity Day, with the theme ‘A strong start for a hopeful future’, WHO is calling on governments, health systems and partners to prioritize quality care for preterm and low birth weight babies. This means ensuring dedicated wards or facilities with specially trained neonatal staff providing round-the-clock care for small and sick newborns, as well as universal access to essential equipment and medicines like antibiotics. Because they have less time in the womb, many preterm babies have underdeveloped lungs, brains, immune systems and capacity for temperature regulation. This increases risks from infections, hypothermia, heart problems, respiratory distress, and other life-threatening complications. “No newborn should die from preventable causes,” said Dr Per Ashorn, WHO’s Unit Head for Newborn and Child Health and Development. “It’s time to ensure every baby gets the attention they need, by investing in special care for small or sick babies, alongside quality maternity services that can prevent many occurrences of preterm birth.”",WHO News,"Fri, 14 Nov 2025 17:39:52 Z",https://www.who.int/news/item/14-11-2025-who-promotes-lifesaving-intervention-for-small-and-preterm-babies-on-first-official-world-prematurity-day,Regulation/Policy
